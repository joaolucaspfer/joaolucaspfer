👋 Hi, I’m @joaolucaspfer, from Belo Horizonte, Brazil — a tech enthusiast and someone who loves bringing faith and technology together.

👀 I’m interested in: technology, evangelization, web development, digital creativity, and any initiative that helps spread good values online.

🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, Bootstrap, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript — and also improving my guitar skills 🎸.

💻 My development focus:

- Building clean, functional, and meaningful web projects;

- Improving my programming logic through multiple languages;

- Studying both front-end and back-end development to become a full‑stack developer;

- Understanding how technology can support evangelization.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: web development projects, open‑source initiatives, and especially Catholic digital projects that help evangelize and inspire others.
